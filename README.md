A template site for ASP.NET vNext using AngularJS
=====================

To use:

1. Clone the repo to a folder of your choosing.

2. On a command prompt, cd to the WebApp folder under src.

3. Run kpm restore

4. Run grunt

5. Run k web

6. Browse to http://localhost:5000/

The folders you'll want to check out for editing purposes are less, app, ng-apps, img and the index.html file in the WebApp folder.

The other files are mostly all generated by the associated grunt tasks.

Enjoy!
