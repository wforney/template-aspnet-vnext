A template site for ASP.NET vNext
=====================

The master branch is relatively empty. It contains the basic build setup with some Angular files.

There is an angular branch that has a template site using AnguarJS. The build is all setup but the template is bare bones.

The durandal branch has been setup with a base DurandalJS installation. At the moment it is a work in progress.

# Roadmap

Some things on the roadmap for future include:
1. Get DurandalJS setup and working with a basic shell.
2. Flesh out the AngularJS template with a little bootstrap layout and add social stuff, make some default icons.
3. Remove the master branch content and improve this documentation. Possibly make a gh-pages branch with a site walkthru.
